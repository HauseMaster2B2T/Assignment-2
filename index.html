  <hs class="second" style="font-family:courier;color:brown;font-size:15pt">Linus Torvalds (born December 28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland) is a Finnish computer scientist who was the principal force behind the development of the Linux operating system.</h2>

  <p class="third" style="font-family:courier;color:brown;font-size:15pt;text-align:left"><img src="http://www.aydinstone.com/vic20.jpg" class="center" alt="Picture of the Commodore Vic 20, on of the first computers he ever had used" style="float:left;height:200px;width:240px;">Linus Torvalds jokes that he was named after the Peanuts character Linus but it is said that he was really named after the Nobel winning chemist Linus Pauling. Linus was interested in computers from a very early age. He began programming on his grandfather's Commodore Vic 20 when he was only 10 years old. Software was hard to get in Finland so Linus began programming his own games.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

His studies were interrupted to serve in the Finnish Navy as part of the country's mandatory service. He achieved the rank of second lietenant. While in university he got to use the Unix operating system on the university computers. He wrote his Master's thesis on Linux.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

However, he did not have enough money to buy Unix so he decided to build his own version of Unix which he named Linux. Linus shared the source code and allowed others to download it for free. Because of their access to the source code, many programmers helped Torvalds retool revise the software, and by 1994 the Linux kernel (original code) version 1.0 was released. Linux as an inexpensive alternative to Windows. In addition to Linux being free, its source code can be viewed and freely modified by anyone, unlike a proprietary OS. </p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
